## Website Description

Trestore is a website that serves two purposes, the first, to facilitate the sale of native trees and seeds to customers, and the second, to offer sponsorship packages to customers so that they can support the replanting of native Irish trees. In the aims of creating an immersive website and encourage repeat visiting and shopping the website offers to dedicate a percentage of each sale directly to planting native trees and tracks the number of trees planted by each user in this manner on their profile creating a sense of achievement and satisfying feedback from each purchase. 

As well as this the website contains a progress blog where employees and administrators of the website can post updates including images of Trestore's replanting efforts and wider company news. Registered users are also able to comment on these posts, intending to create a sense of engagement between the customers and the store and enhancing the sense of involvement that the customer feels with regards to the company's goal of planting native trees and woodlands. 

While creating the design for the website I wanted to use a colour scheme and layout that emphasised the green and environmental nature of the purpose of the website. Additionally, to make the user experience as seamless and easy as possible the website also emphasises intuitive page and website interaction. With simple and clear action buttons on the home page and the most important page interactions highlighted with buttons styled in line with the website's branding, the website has a cohesive and connected feeling throughout, attempting to elevate the user's experience of using the site.

### Design

#### Design Overview

There were 2 major ideas behind the design of this website which were present and helped to inform almost all design decisions. The first of these was to express the website's driving environmental goals through a cohesive and strongly branded design emphasising the green shades and colours of nature and woodlands. The second idea behind the website's design was to ensure at all points that the user was aware of the most important interactions, and provided with clear feedback as well as a clear information hierarchy.

#### Colour Scheme

![Image of Trestore colour scheme](https://github.com/zackgithuboriginal/trestore-milestone-project-4/blob/master/docs/trestore-colour-scheme.png)

#### Primary Colours

In the creation of the branding and design for the website, I decided to draw on nature and the trees that the store would be selling for the colour scheme of the website. The primary brand colour for the website is #336857 a full green colour chosen to evoke a sense of the relationship between the company and nature and the trees and woodlands that it supports through its sales and sponsorship packages. As the primary branding colour, it is used as a background colour in the majority of the buttons and points of interaction on the site, as well as the text colour of a lot of the headings to ensure an easy to read, consistent cohesive experience throughout the design.

The other two colours in Trestore's scheme are #F2F8F7 and #1A342C. The first, #F2F8F7 is a light white colour with a green tone, the second #1A342C is a very dark shade of green. These two secondary colours are used opposite each other in the website's design. They are used primarily as the background colour of the various pages of the site and in the case of #F2F8F7, it is used along with #FFFFFF, plain white, as the background colour of a lot of the text pieces and information points on the website to ensure clarity and ease of comprehension.

#### Typography

There are two fonts in use in the design of the website, the first, Josefin Slab is a delicate and notable font, though still very readable. It is used as the font for the website's brand on the navbar as well as the font of the text on the home page banner. The second font used, Open Sans, is a very clean and readable font. It is used

#### Imagery

Imagery is used in a few places throughout the website. On the home page and the progress blog, there is a large SVG icon of a tree which is used to create a visual representation of the website's relationship to nature and woodlands. Along this same line, the basket icon is an icon of a branch to represent the fact that the basket is going to be containing trees and seeds and to give visual feedback of that to the user. Additionally in the login and register pages, there is a large background image of a tree backlit by the sky. These images were all used alongside the colour design to create a sense of the brand of the website.

The other images in use in the design are ones that can be uploaded with products or with progress posts. To create a more engaging experience when browsing and reading progress posts, site admins can upload images that will be at the top and centre of the postcard. Additionally with regards to products images can be uploaded to display to the user what the product will look like, and create a more comprehensive and informed shopping experience.

### Wireframes

The wireframes for the website were developed using [Figma](https://www.figma.com/)

### Database Design / Data Modelling

![Image of data schema diagram](https://github.com/zackgithuboriginal/trestore-milestone-project-4/blob/master/docs/data-schema.png)


#### ProgressPost model

The ProgressPost model is the model used to store details for posts in the progress blog. It stores the basic details of the post such as the title, the post content, the date posted and an image as well as having a ForeignKey field to store the author's userprofile object. This is to provide an author's name to the post.

    class ProgressPost(models.Model):

    post_title = models.CharField(max_length=60, null=False, blank=False)
    post_content = models.CharField(max_length=2000, null=False, blank=False)
    image = models.ImageField(null=True, blank=True)
    date = models.DateTimeField(auto_now_add=True, editable=False)
    author = models.ForeignKey(UserProfile, on_delete=models.SET_NULL,
                               null=True, related_name='posts', editable=False)

#### Comment model

The Comment model is used to store details of comments made on posts in the progress blog. It stores the basic details of the comment such as the comment content and date posted as well as two ForeignKey fields, the post that the comment is attached to and the author of the post which is related to the user's userprofile object. This is to provide an author's name to the comment.

    class Comment(models.Model):

    post = models.ForeignKey(ProgressPost, null=False, blank=False,
                             on_delete=models.CASCADE, related_name='comments',
                             editable=False)
    comment_content = models.CharField(max_length=400, null=False, blank=False)
    date = models.DateTimeField(auto_now_add=True, editable=False)
    author = models.ForeignKey(UserProfile, on_delete=models.SET_NULL,
                               null=True, related_name='comments',
                               editable=False)

#### User model

The User model is inherited from the Django.contrib.allauth module. It is used to authenticate users and provide the ability to register and sign in to the store and the session. It contains basic details such as the username and email address as well as a password field and boolean fields specifying whether or not the user is a superuser and whether or not they have verified the email.

    class User(models.Model):
    
        username = models.CharField(
        _('username'),
        max_length=150,
        unique=True,
        help_text=_('Required. 150 characters or fewer. Letters, digits and @/./+/-/_ only.'),
        validators=[username_validator],
        error_messages={
            'unique': _("A user with that username already exists."),
        },
        )
        first_name = models.CharField(_('first name'), max_length=150, blank=True)
        last_name = models.CharField(_('last name'), max_length=150, blank=True)
        email = models.EmailField(_('email address'), blank=True)
        is_staff = models.BooleanField(
            _('staff status'),
            default=False,
            help_text=_('Designates whether the user can log into this admin site.'),
        )
        is_active = models.BooleanField(
            _('active'),
            default=True,
            help_text=_(
                'Designates whether this user should be treated as active. '
                'Unselect this instead of deleting accounts.'
            ),
        )



#### UserProfile model

The UserProfile model is the model used to track the activity and details of a customer or user of the store. It has a one to one relationship with the User model to enable signing in and out of the session and providing access to personal details if authenticated. The model contains the user's delivery details if they have elected to store them for the future, as well as the tree_planting_contribution field. Which tracks the total number of trees planted due to their orders.

    class UserProfile(models.Model):

    user = models.OneToOneField(User, on_delete=models.CASCADE)
    default_full_name = models.CharField(max_length=50,
                                         null=True, blank=True)
    default_street_address1 = models.CharField(max_length=80,
                                               null=True, blank=True)
    default_street_address2 = models.CharField(max_length=80,
                                               null=True, blank=True)
    default_town_or_city = models.CharField(max_length=40,
                                            null=True, blank=True)
    default_postcode = models.CharField(max_length=20,
                                        null=True, blank=True)
    default_county = models.CharField(max_length=80,
                                      null=True, blank=True)
    default_country = CountryField(blank_label="Country",
                                   null=True, blank=True)
    tree_planting_contribution = models.DecimalField(max_digits=10,
                                                     decimal_places=2,
                                                     default=0.00)

#### Orders model

The Order model is the model used to track orders made in the store. It contains all of the payment and delivery details as well as a ForeignKey field containing the user's UserProfile object if they are signed in.

    class Order(models.Model):

    order_number = models.CharField(max_length=32, null=False, editable=False)
    user_profile = models.ForeignKey(UserProfile, on_delete=models.SET_NULL,
                                     null=True, blank=True,
                                     related_name='orders')
    full_name = models.CharField(max_length=50, null=False, blank=False)
    email = models.EmailField(max_length=254, null=False, blank=False)
    country = CountryField(blank_label="Country *", null=False, blank=False)
    postcode = models.CharField(max_length=20, null=True, blank=True)
    town_or_city = models.CharField(max_length=40, null=False, blank=False)
    street_address1 = models.CharField(max_length=80, null=False, blank=False)
    street_address2 = models.CharField(max_length=80, null=True, blank=True)
    county = models.CharField(max_length=80, null=True, blank=True)
    date = models.DateTimeField(auto_now_add=True)
    delivery_cost = models.DecimalField(max_digits=6, decimal_places=2,
                                        null=False, default=0)
    order_total = models.DecimalField(max_digits=10, decimal_places=2,
                                      null=False, default=0)
    grand_total = models.DecimalField(max_digits=10, decimal_places=2,
                                      null=False, default=0)
    basket = models.TextField(null=False, blank=False, default='')
    stripe_pid = models.CharField(max_length=254, null=False,
                                  blank=False, default='')

#### OrderLineItem model

The OrderLineItem model is used to store the product and quantity details of each order. For every product in the basket at the time of the checkout, an OrderLineItem object is created containing the Product object and the quantity of that product in the basket as well as the Order object of the order it is attached to and the linitem_total or subtotal of the quantity of the product.

    class OrderLineItem(models.Model):

    order = models.ForeignKey(Order,
                              null=False,
                              blank=False,
                              on_delete=models.CASCADE,
                              related_name='lineitems')
    product = models.ForeignKey(Product,
                                null=False,
                                blank=False,
                                on_delete=models.CASCADE)
    quantity = models.IntegerField(null=False,
                                   blank=False,
                                   default=0)
    lineitem_total = models.DecimalField(max_digits=10,
                                         decimal_places=2,
                                         null=False,
                                         blank=False,
                                         editable=False)

#### Product model

The product model is used to store details about each product in the store. It contains the basic details of the product such as name description price SKU and image, as well as a ForeignKey field related to the Category model containing the category of the product.

    class Product(models.Model):
   
    category = models.ForeignKey('Category', null=True, blank=True,
                                 on_delete=models.SET_NULL)
    product_name = models.CharField(max_length=254)
    sku = models.CharField(max_length=254, null=True, blank=True)
    product_description = models.TextField()
    price = models.DecimalField(max_digits=6, decimal_places=2)
    image = models.ImageField(null=True, blank=True)

#### Category model

The Category model is used to store the basic details regarding the categories of products offered in the store.

    class Category(models.Model):

    class Meta:
        verbose_name_plural = 'Categories'

    name = models.CharField(max_length=254)
    friendly_name = models.CharField(max_length=254, null=True, blank=True)

## Features

#### Home Page

![Image of responsive page mockups]()

The home page has two major roles. 

#### Store Page

The store page is simply designed, prioritising above all a clean and clear user experience and access to information and products. The page has two sections, the first of these two sections is the product sort filtering and search section. This section provides users three options to customise the display of products in the store, offering the ability to filter by a category, sort by either price ascending, price descending or by category and finally to filter results by search terms. By submitting these parameters the products displayed on the page will change to suit the needs and interests of the customer and create a positive user experience when browsing.

The second section is the product container wherein products are displayed on card elements in a responsive grid to provide a satisfying and easy browsing experience.
The product card contains several features including a product image, the product name, price and SKU value, a link to the product details page for that product and a quantity input field with a button to add the product to the basket.

#### Navbar

The navbar is fixed at the top of the base template so that it appears on all pages of the site. It contains links to all of the primary pages as well as a dropdown list providing links related to profile actions and certain restricted actions such as adding products to the store.

The colour of the navbar is the primary branding colour of the website to create a cohesive environment across all of the pages and applications of the site.

#### Progress Blog

The progress blog is the page that visitors can go to to learn about the company and see updates and news from the company about its various tree-planting efforts. The page contains a primary container for the posts themselves as well as the background image of the SVG tree that is also used on the home page. 
The Post container has two main components, an add post button, that will display if the active user is authorised and the post display.

The post display consists of a series of post cards displayed vertically with the newest post at the top. The post card itself has several elements. If the user is authorised there is an options menu dropdown button on the head of the post, with an image below and the content of the post just above the base. Along the base of the post, there is the date that the post was published, the author of the post and finally, a show comments button.

When the show comment button is pressed the comments section will open, containing the add comment form and the comments that are already attached to the post.

#### Add / Edit Post Page

The add and edit post pages are relatively simple, they contain a form with an input field for each of the fields of the post model. In the case of the image field, a custom Django widget is used, which allows for the display of the image if one is already in use.

### Manual Functionality Testing

Page | Action | Expected Result | Result
-------- | ------------- | ------------- | ---------
EXAMPLE | EXAMPLE ACTION | EXAMPLE RESULT | Pass


### Bugs Discovered 

1.
The first bug that I will highlight is an issue that arose regarding the input of stored details for user's when checking out an order. The user's full name field would not be filled in along with the other saved data.

![Image of name not being input issue](https://github.com/zackgithuboriginal/trestore-milestone-project-4/blob/master/docs/name-not-input-bug.PNG)

After investigating the issue I figured out that the issue was being caused by the full_name field being input by a method of the user model called get_full_name(). The issue was arising because in the registration field there was no input field for the user to enter their name in the first place, therefore the method was called on empty fields and returning nothing.

    order_form = OrderForm(initial={
        'full_name': profile.user.get_full_name(),

I solved this issue by reworking the code to use the same method for supplying the name as the other fields in the form. By taking them from the stored value of the userprofile object.

    order_form = OrderForm(initial={
        'full_name': profile.default_full_name,

This solved the issue immediately and was a very simple solution to the issue.

![Image of name not being input solution](https://github.com/zackgithuboriginal/trestore-milestone-project-4/blob/master/docs/name-not-input-bug-resolve.PNG)

2.
The second bug was a relatively minor one relating to the rendering of an email field to the order confirmation page. In the order confirmation page, instead of the user's email address being rendered as was intended, the Django template expression was rendered in raw format.

![Image of email not being rendered](https://github.com/zackgithuboriginal/trestore-milestone-project-4/blob/master/docs/template-bug.PNG)

A quick investigation of the HTML for that template revealed that the expression had been split across multiple lines by an HTML formatted that I had used on the HTML file. 

![Image of email not being rendered code](https://github.com/zackgithuboriginal/trestore-milestone-project-4/blob/master/docs/template-bug-code.PNG)

By tweaking the HTML slightly and putting the expression back on one line, the problem was solved and the email was rendered correctly.
