DEPLOYMENT# Trestore - Milestone Project 4

![Image of responsive page mockups]()

## Website Description

Trestore is a website that serves two purposes, the first, to facilitate the sale of native trees and seeds to customers and the second, to offer sponsorship packages to customers so that they can support the replanting of native Irish trees. In order to  During the design of the website I wanted to use a colour scheme and design that emphasised the green and environmental nature of the purpose of the website. 

In order to make the user experience as seamless and easy as possible the website also emphasises intuitive page and website interaction. With simple and clear CTA buttons from the home page and the most important page interactions highlighted with buttons styled with the website's primary branding colour.

### Design

#### Design Overview
There were two driving principles behind the design of this website and these were firstly to create an environment in which there is a clear hierarchy of importance with user’s content and posts being foremost and secondly to create an easily understandable and intuitive navigation and interaction interface.

#### Colour Scheme
![Image of responsive page mockups]()
#### Primary Colours
In the creation of the branding and design for the website I decided to draw on nature and the trees that the store would be selling for the colour scheme of the website. The primary brand colour for the website is #336857 a deep green colour reminiscent #F2F8F7 #1A342C

### Database Design / Data Modelling

![Image of data schema diagram]()


#### Object model

![Image of post collection object]()

The posts collection is where all of the posts made by users are stored in the database. It uses MongoDB's ObjectId value as a unique key and stores all other details necessary to the display and tracking of the post in its data fields.

    example_attribute:             string




## Features

#### Home Page

![Image of responsive page mockups]()

The home page has two major roles. Firstly, its role is to introduce the user to the website and enable them to understand its purpose and functionality. Secondly, the home page is the primary means of exploring user’s posts and discovering new ideas and discussions.

To achieve the first goal I aimed to make the purpose of the home page as simple and clear as possible. Upon loading the page the user is presented with a column of posts down the centre of the page with a toolbar just above them with options to filter and sort. The user upon interacting with the scrollable list of posts will get an idea of the purpose of the site and will understand that this is an environment for creating and sharing posts.

The second goal of the home page to be the primary post navigation screen is achieved by utilising several smaller features to make the functionality of viewing and exploring posts as convenient and intuitive as possible.

#### Store Page

The store page is a simply designed page, prioritising above all a clean and clear user experience and access to information and products. The page has two sections, the first of these two sections is the product sort filtering and search section. This section provides users three options to customise the display of products in the store, offering the ability to filter by category, sort by either price ascending, price descending or by category and finally to filter results by search terms. By sumitting these parameters the products displayed on the page will change to suit the needs and intersests of the customer and create a positive user experience when browsing.

The second section is the product container wherein products are displayed on card elements in a responsive grid to provide a satisfying and easy browsing experience.
The product card contains a number of features including a product image, the product name, price and SKU value, a link to the product details page for that product and a quantity input field with a button to add the product to the basket.

#### Navbar

The navbar is fixed at the top of the base template so that it appears on all pages of the site. It comtains links to all of the primary pages as well as a dropdown list providing links related to profile actions and certain restricted actions such as adding products to the store.

The colour of the navbar is the primary branding colour of the website in order to create a cohesive environment across all of the pages and applications of the site.
