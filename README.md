### Design

#### Design Overview
There were two driving principles behind the design of this website and these were firstly to create an environment in which there is a clear hierarchy of importance with user’s content and posts being foremost and secondly to create an easily understandable and intuitive navigation and interaction interface.

### Database Design / Data Modelling

#### Object model

![Image of post collection object]()

The posts collection is where all of the posts made by users are stored in the database. It uses MongoDB's ObjectId value as a unique key and stores all other details necessary to the display and tracking of the post in its data fields.

    example_attribute:             string




## Features

#### Home Page

![Image of responsive page mockups]()

The home page has two major roles. Firstly, its role is to introduce the user to the website and enable them to understand its purpose and functionality. Secondly, the home page is the primary means of exploring user’s posts and discovering new ideas and discussions.

To achieve the first goal I aimed to make the purpose of the home page as simple and clear as possible. Upon loading the page the user is presented with a column of posts down the centre of the page with a toolbar just above them with options to filter and sort. The user upon interacting with the scrollable list of posts will get an idea of the purpose of the site and will understand that this is an environment for creating and sharing posts.

The second goal of the home page to be the primary post navigation screen is achieved by utilising several smaller features to make the functionality of viewing and exploring posts as convenient and intuitive as possible.
