## Project Testing

### Browser and Device Size Testing
The website was tested thoroughly across all major browsers and all screen and device size down to 360px. 

- [Mozilla Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/)

- [Google Chrome](https://www.google.com/intl/en_ie/chrome/)

- [Microsoft Edge](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/edge)

- [Opera](https://www.opera.com/)

- A full range of sizes and devices using Chrome DevTools, [Responsive Viewer](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/responsive-viewer/inmopeiepgfljkpkidclfgbgbmfcennb?hl=en) and [Am I Responsive?](http://ami.responsivedesign.is/)

### Code Validation

At the end of the project, the code was put through CSS, HTML, JS and Pep8 Python validators to ensure there were no errors presented.

### Bugs Discovered 

1.
The first bug that I will highlight is an issue that arose regarding the input of stored details for user's when checking out an order. The user's full name field would not be filled in along with the other saved data.

![Image of name not being input issue](https://github.com/zackgithuboriginal/trestore-milestone-project-4/blob/master/docs/name-not-input-bug.PNG)

After investigating the issue I figured out that the issue was being caused by the full_name field being input by a method of the user model called get_full_name(). The issue was arising because in the registration field there was no input field for the user to enter their name in the first place, therefore the method was called on empty fields and returning nothing.

    order_form = OrderForm(initial={
        'full_name': profile.user.get_full_name(),

I solved this issue by reworking the code to use the same method for supplying the name as the other fields in the form. By taking them from the stored value of the userprofile object.

    order_form = OrderForm(initial={
        'full_name': profile.default_full_name,

This solved the issue immediately and was a very simple solution to the issue.

![Image of name not being input solution](https://github.com/zackgithuboriginal/trestore-milestone-project-4/blob/master/docs/name-not-input-bug-resolve.PNG)

2.
The second bug was a relatively minor one relating to the rendering of an email field to the order confirmation page. In the order confirmation page, instead of the user's email address being rendered as was intended, the Django template expression was rendered in raw format.

![Image of email not being rendered](https://github.com/zackgithuboriginal/trestore-milestone-project-4/blob/master/docs/template-bug.PNG)

A quick investigation of the HTML for that template revealed that the expression had been split across multiple lines by an HTML formatted that I had used on the HTML file. 

![Image of email not being rendered code](https://github.com/zackgithuboriginal/trestore-milestone-project-4/blob/master/docs/template-bug-code.PNG)

By tweaking the HTML slightly and putting the expression back on one line, the problem was solved and the email was rendered correctly.
